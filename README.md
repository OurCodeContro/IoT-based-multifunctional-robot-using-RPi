# IoT-based-multifunctional-robot-using-RPi
This repository contains all the codes for mentioned project. This projet is developed using Raspberry-Pi in python. 
This robo can be controlled using Wiimote as well as from internet making it IoT based robot.

Features of Robot:

-voice recognition (tasks based on voice e.g- if user says "make me laugh" then robo plays Minion laughing audios etc.)
-PDF book reading from Flash Drives
-Home Automation(through voice)
-Live Streaming (video surveillance)
-Controlling robot through remote and using Internet though Web interface
